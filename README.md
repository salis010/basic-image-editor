The very basic starting point for an image editing functionality on a website.

Ideal to ask for a profile pic from a users and giving them the facility to select the best part.

To run, install the package.json dependencies, start the node server and go to localhost:3000 in your browser.

First, the app lets the user choose an image.

The selected image appears on a canvas element with some transperancy.

The only implemented functionality is a basic crop with a fixed size. The box at the top left can be dragged to the desired cropping location.

The crop coordinates together with the image are uploaded to the server which crops the image accordingly and saves it as a new file.

Up to you to add functionalities to this basic app as required.
